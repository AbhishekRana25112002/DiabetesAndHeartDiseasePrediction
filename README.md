# Diabetes and Heart Disease Prediction Models

This repository contains two machine learning models for predicting diabetes and heart disease based on the respective datasets. The models are implemented in Python using popular machine learning libraries.

## Diabetes Prediction Model

### Files:
- `Project_3_Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the diabetes prediction model.
- `diabetes.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing the model.

### Dependencies:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

### Steps:
1. Data Collection and Analysis
2. Data Standardization
3. Train-Test Split
4. Model Training (Ensemble of SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors)
5. Model Evaluation using Accuracy Score
6. Making Predictions for New Data

## Heart Disease Prediction Model

### Files:
- `HeartDiseasePrediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the heart disease prediction model.
- `heart.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing the model.

### Dependencies:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

### Steps:
1. Data Exploration and Visualization
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Model Selection (Random Forest)
4. Model Training and Evaluation
5. Making Predictions for New Data
